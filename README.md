# West Virginia Heatmap (Choropleth)

## Introduction

This is a program created for a final project in my Data Mining course. The goal was to use a data mining technique on a large amount of
data. This program uses county-level data for the state of West Virginia and visualizes it using the choropleth functionality from the
Plotly library. This visualization technique was chosen in order to make quick comparisons between the datasets and to see if any correlation
between the datasets could be discerned. 

## Data Used
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 Infections by County</li>
<li>COVID-19 Deaths by County</li>
<li>Opioid Perscriptions Rates by County</li>
